##### 6/22/22 - Code 102 - Day Three

Today I learned about Git, the software underneath Github. I learned that it is a way to collaborate with others on the same project, save your work, and prevent problems from arising during the process. I learned some basic Git commands, such as:



* Version Control Systems help to record changes throughout the process of a project, so that mistakes can be fixed easily.
* Distributed Version Control Systems, like **Git**, allow for multiple mirrored repositories to prevent data loss and allow for teams to collaborate and complete joint projects.
*  What Git is:
   * Snapshots
  Saved references of your work every time it is saved (/committed)
   * Local Operations
  A project history is saved to a local disk as opposed to calling on a server for it
   * Tracking Changes
  Every change is tracked, which helps detect file issues
   * Loss of Data
  Highly difficult for snapshots to be lost
   * States
      * _Committed_
      Stored in local database
      * _Modified_
      Changed but not committed
      * _Staged_
      Flagged a file's changed version to be comitted in the next snapshot
* Git's the most popular VCS in the world
* Workflow
  * _Working Directory_
  The actual files reside here
  * _Index_
  The area for staging
  * _Head_
  Points to the most recent commit

## Lecture Notes

- git lives on your machine
- github is on the web
- git is used for sharing code
- git lets multiple devs work on the same code
- repository is really just a folder
- helps with collaboration
- commits are snapshots in time of the document
- 'head' current state, where you're at, all else is historical
- you give the snapshot a label called a message
- github is not git. you push your code to github. effectively an online backup.
- uses git's features to help manage work
- a repo is is a collection of files you've told git to pay attention to
- one project = one repo, usually
- really large projects might have multiple repositories for different parts of their system
- repos can live on github and/or computer
