* Version Control Systems help to record changes throughout the process of a project, so that mistakes can be fixed easily.
* Distributed Version Control Systems, like **Git**, allow for multiple mirrored repositories to prevent data loss and allow for teams to collaborate and complete joint projects.
*  What Git is:
 * Snapshots
  Saved references of your work every time it is saved (/committed)
 * Local Operations
  A project history is saved to a local disk as opposed to calling on a server for it
 * Tracking Changes
  Every change is tracked, which helps detect file issues
 * Loss of Data
  Highly difficult for snapshots to be lost
 * States
   * Committed
   * Modified
   * Staged
