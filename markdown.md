###### 6/20/22 - Code 102 - Day One

Today I reviewed information about **Markdown**. Markdown is a language that helps to format documents easily. With some slight syntax changes, you can:

* create bulletpoints
* create numbered lists
* bold and italic text
* create headers of varying sizes
* create hyperlinks
* embed images
..and much more.

I want to point out some features I was previously unaware of. I did not know that you can create footnotes[^1]. I was also surprised to learn about task boxes.

- [x] Day One of Code 102
- [ ] Day Two of Code 102
