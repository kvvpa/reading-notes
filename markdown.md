# Learning Markdown

##### 6/20/22 - Code 102 - Day One

Today was the first class of Code 102: Introduction to Web Development. After class introductions and an orientation slideshow, I reviewed information about **Markdown**. Markdown is a language that helps to format documents easily. With some syntax, you can format a document using nothing but text. It was explained that Markdown is used every day by developers for documentation. Some examples of what can be done are:

* create bulletpoints
* create numbered lists
* **bold** and _italic_ text
* create headers of varying sizes
* create [hyperlinks](https://github.com/kvvpa)
* `code snippets`
* embed images
..and much more.

I want to highlight some features I was previously unaware of. I did not know that you can create footnotes.[^1] I was also surprised to learn about task lists[^2] such as these:

- [x] Day One of Code 102
- [ ] Day Two of Code 102

We also reviewed how to navigate [Github](https://github.com) and create .md files from within the website.
