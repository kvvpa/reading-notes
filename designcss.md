* CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* It allows you to specify the appearance of the elements within an HTML document. CSS can help to change how things are positioned, what text looks like, and how content is displayed.
* Default styling exists already within the browser (/user agent), and will require a "CSS Reset" in order to control all of it manually.
* CSS is a rule-based language, meaning you choose an HTML element and apply specific rules to it to make it display how you like.

The syntax looks like:

```
h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
    color: orange;
}
```

...using curly braces, colons, and semicolons.

* CSS specifications are developed by a group called the **CSS Working Group** within W3C. It is constantly evolving and new features continue to be added, while keeping old standards so that websites don't break.
