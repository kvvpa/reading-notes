## growth mindset

Growth mindset is acceptance that it is **within your power** to make things happen. It is the difference between courage and fear, and an instrinsic acceptance of failure as a normal part of one's journey towards goals and greatness.

I can remind myself to stay in a growth mindset by:

* Remembering my _why_. I am doing this to find fulfilling and meaningful work that will allow me to take care of the people I love and live up to the potential I know I have.
* Remembering that what I do not understand now is only an indicater of what I will eventually understand so long as I persist.
* Not seeking perfection because perfection doesn't exist.

>_Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnâ€™t do than by the ones you did do. So sail away from the safe harbour. Explore, Dream, Discover._ **- Mark Twain**
