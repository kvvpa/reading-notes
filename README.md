## introduction

[![My Selfie](https://i.postimg.cc/VLYBjmFP/selfiethumb.jpg)][Github]

I am a Web Developer-in-training at [Code Fellows](https://codefellows.org).

My name is Joseph Cristina, but I prefer to go by Joey. My pronouns are he/him and I currently live in the Grand Mound area of Centralia, Washington (80 minutes south of Seattle). My background consists of mostly sales jobs. The only technical job I've ever had is as a cable technician for one of Comcast's contractors. Most notably to me, I founded [CapCity Presents](https://capcitypresents.com) and booked/managed/promoted hundreds of live concert events throughout the bulk of my 20's. As much work as that was, it didn't lead to a worthwhile career, so here I am! I've been dabbling with code off and on for years (mostly HTML and CSS) but I am really excited for this opportunity and I'm looking forward to deepening my understanding of all facets of web development.
