# Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript

##### 6/25/22 - Code 102 - Day Six

* Javascript is a programming language
* Javascript and Java are two entirely differnet programming languages and just share a name similarity.
* It is used mostly for web pages, but also used in other environments.

# Variables

* Variables are containers for storing data. They hold values like algebra.
* Also like algebra, variables are used in expressions.
* 4 ways to declare variable
  * _var_
  * _let_
  * _const_
  * _nothing_
* Variables must be identified with unique case-sensitive names, called _identifiers_.
* `=` is an assignment operator, wheras `==` is an 'equal to' operator.
* It's best practice to declare variables at the beginning of a script.
* Variables declared without a value will have the value `undefined`.

# Data Types

* Numbers
* Strings (single or double quotes)
* Booleans
* NaN
* Undefined
